<p>Reading again my post today, I'm a bit embarrassed by the way I have written my opinions.
At some places, it feels more like a rant, and to be honest it was, which was immature of me.</p>
<p>For the sake of testimony, I will still keep this article as it was and not temper with it.
It is one of my principles to consider that everyone changes with time, but that we must be able to face critically our history in order to really improve, and we are accountable for what we say in the public space.
Instead of tempering with the past, I'd rather write apologies and erratum to own my mistakes.</p>
<p>Do not take the words below for my current opinion, <em>especially when I talk about Capgemini Invent</em>.
Neither should you think that I now believe the opposite.
I have a more nuanced opinion that could be developped elsewhere.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the core message of this blogpost (the conclusion) remains the same (at the time of writing of this update).</p>
<h2>[back to the blogpost]</h2>
<p>My internship at Capgemini Invent as a Data Scientist Intern has been a very valuable experience.
I had the opportunity to meet many interesting people, motivated, eager to learn and ready to tackle any kind of challenge.
The mood was always amazing !</p>
<p><em>However.</em></p>
<p>In the open space, a discussion was quite recurrent between Data Scientists.
A discussion that would trigger tensions, a discussion that some people were not comfortable with.
It all came from a question that no one could really answer, a question lurking in the shadow in everyone's mind that would tickle now and then the paradoxal beings that we are:</p>
<h2>What is a Data Scientist ?</h2>
<p>Let's put aside the dramatic effects aside and avoid the meta-philosophical discussions that we can be tempted to have around the meaning of life and such.
Let's talk concrete stuff.
When you dig a bit into this from a pragmatic point of view, this question often transforms into another: <em>what is the job of a Data Scientist</em> ?</p>
<p>One can fetch the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">definition of Data Sciences on Wikipedia</a> seeking for help from the worldwide collaborative intelligence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is obviously a good definition since it has been edited over 986 times.
Using this definition, and the proposition that Data Scientists are the people doing Data Science, we can infer a definition for Data Scientists, and this will be my own :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data Scientists unveil patterns by combining data with mathematics, computer sciences and additional domain knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, I have cheated and changed the last part, inspired by <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-three-cores-of-data-science-d58af0d7361e">this famous chart</a>.
Data Scientists have a goal: to model phenomenons quantitatively.
This can be quite simple with only descriptive statistics, a few plots and some common sense.
This can be more complex using statistical methods and mathematical modeling to highlight mecanisms.
This can be the automation of decision-making processes (thus raising the term Artificial Intelligence) using inference algorithms and Machine Learning.
This can be so many different things I am not going to cover them all.</p>
<p>In the end, in order to define what a Data Scientist is, what matters is</p>
<ol>
<li>the fact that they work on data,</li>
<li>the skillset needed to be a Data Scientist : good fundamentals in mathematics, good skills in computer sciences and good understanding of the domain.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a nice definition that can be applied to many people who claim to be Data Scientists, but reality is not that simple.
Companies seldom think it is good enough to plot things, to send a Jupyter Notebook to a client or a folder with Python scripts. <strong>In the real real life, people want applications</strong>, things that they can continue to use, things with which they can interact.
And that is where it all begins.</p>
<h2>Are Data Scientists developers ?</h2>
<p>Making an application is a tedious process that requires craftsmanship knowledge called "Software Engineering".
Building <em>properly</em> any kind of application, even the simplest ones like a website with a few interacting plots, is no small feat.
I insist on "properly".
Thanks to the age of information and all the available ressources to learn how to develop for free, anybody can learn how to make a native application, a website or a mobile application in only a few weeks, but it would most certainly not meet the expectations of a professional.</p>
<p>In order to introduce the problem, here is an image: would you rather give the construction of your house to someone that just learned how to cement bricks, or to a more experimented worker who can cement bricks like the previous one (maybe a bit better) but also knows the implications of his work on the other tasks and has the best safety mesures in order for accident not to occur ?</p>
<p>If you ask a Computer Scientist to fix your Windows configuration, there is a lot of chances that he will not succeed (well, there is a bias since most of us are nerds anyway... so it could happen :-D) because theoretical understanding of the Dijkstra algorithm will not help him make your laptop work.
So you'd better contact the technical support desk, they have the right skills and knowledge.
It is the same with software development : why would you not contact software developers ?</p>
<p>Against that common sense, Data Scientists at Capgemini Invent had to write pieces of software.
I have spent the first two months of my Data Science internship writing a web application of HR.
I have discussed with other Data Scientists whose missions were to write REST APIs.
Basically, a Data Scientist did not always do the job of a Data Scientist according to the definition above.</p>
<p>I have seen some applications written by senior Data Scientists who were very good at Data Sciences become, well, quick and dirty "things" (not to say "monsters") because they were actually beginners in Software development.
You have to start somewhere, but is a professional project for a client the best place to start learning something so huge ?</p>
<p>I insist: making in time an application that does what is wanted and which can be adapted to new requirements is a job requiring a skillset of its own.
I am not saying that it is not possible to be both a Data Scientist and a Software Developer, because I think I am, but I want to highlight the fact that those skillset do not intersect that much.</p>
<p>I also agree that you have to be <em>flexible</em>.
It is important to be able to adapt to the needs of a client.
If we are building a Machine Learning workflow that requires an API, I will build the API, especially when I have the knownledge and skills to do it.
But sometimes it felt more like Data Scientists were viewed as developers.
That raised some issues because you had people really not happy about their work, not because it was fundamentally not pleasing but because it was not what was promised.</p>
<p>In my case, if I had wanted to do software engineering for my internship, I would have done it in a company which actual job was software engineering, with the right kind of management, organization, tools and mentoring.
I wanted to do a Data Science internship to work on Data Sciences projects.
I was promised such projects, and started not working on that, and it sucked.
I quickly talked with my manager about my thoughts on the matter, and I like to think he looked concerned and understood.
After two months of non-enjoyable work, I finally had the chance to switch to an incredible project and all got good, but I think that if I had not insisted so much to leave the project I would have been left there for my whole internship.</p>
<h2>Why has it come to this ?</h2>
<p>I think that the issue first comes from the decision of making Data Scientists do software engineering work.
This is decided by the project manager, based on the needs of the client and his evaluation of the skills required and the skills his team has.</p>
<p>Sometime you don't really get a say in this decision, and that is bad luck.
It can be so when you have already done something similar and the pressure to meet the expectations of the client as fast as possible is high.
Since you have done something that in the end did the job, whether what you did was well done or not becomes irrelevant in face of the pressure.
That's when they expect you to show some "team spirit" and take your part of the pressure.</p>
<p>This can also happen without any pressure.
In such cases, it is rare for the manager not to ask the Data Scientist if he can do what is wanted.
And this is were it gets ugly: if the Data Scientist has no clue about Software Engineering, he can be oblivious to the fact that it is not that simple.
The complexity of the job gets underevaluated.
This can turn into a nightmare when the requirements change, the Data Scientist is overwhelmed by the job and the team stresses as the deadline gets closer.</p>
<p>At some point, there is a discussion needed between the management and the Data Scientists.
Data Scientists should be sensitized to the fact that Software Engineering is not that easy.
Managers should know that developping applications is not in the skillset of Data Scientits by default <em>even if he can code</em>.</p>
<p>That's my own analysis, and I would be glad to discuss about it: don't hesitate to comment below !</p>
<h2>The intersection</h2>
<p>I also had the opportunity to have great discussions with a Software Engineer about it.
To him, Data Scientists were developers.
Of course, I was not agreeing with him, and we had a few occasions to share about it.
And then it clicked and I understood what was happening.
We were talking about "developers", and we had different definitions, hence we had different point of views that could only conflict.
To him, a "developer" was someone who wrote code.
To me, a "developer" was someone who built applications.
Interestingly, once that was figured out, we had even better conversations about that, and I could agree to many of his arguments.</p>
<p>Let's make a distinction: I will now say that <strong>Data Scientists are coders</strong>.
That can be said as most of a Data Scientist's work is done with code.
Code is here defined as all ways to express logic in a structured syntax.
A few years ago, most of the Data Science work was done in R, now it is Python.</p>
<p>Remember when I was saying that the skillsets of Data Scientists and Software Engineers was not that much ?
This intersection are the coding skills, the ability to express logic in a structured syntax.
As we will see, there are many good inspirations to take from the Software Engineering world for Data Scientists, but before that I want to highlight some key differences.</p>
<h3>Two different stories</h3>
<p>When writing code, a very important component to structure the job is the workflow.
It is hard to define a general workflow for all Data Science jobs since there can be so many unrelated tasks.
In addition to the complexity stemming from the diveristy, the workflow for a Data Science project is very different from the workflows for Software Development projects by nature.
An agile (modern) Software Development project will iterate over features in scopes, and the scopes and the features can move a lot with time as iterations are completed and the requirements reviewed, but in my opinion it is nothing compared to the ever changing todo list of a Data Scientist.
A Data Science project is a very experimental process, and while the implementation of a feature can be complex, it usually remains straightforward: at the end you either did or did not implement the feature.
A data scient task usually results in a non binary completion status, and a single task can end up forking into a multitude of subtasks endlessly.</p>
<p>This fundamental difference will make some "good practice" of Software Engineering not possible.
I have seen Data Science projects managed like development projects and the successes of it were never obvious.
I think this is because of this fundamental difference.</p>
<h3>Good tools please</h3>
<p>If it is hard to apply organizational ideas from Software Engineering to Data Science projects, there are still many things that should inspire Data Scientists.
First, many fundamental good tools used in every good development project should be a must.</p>
<p>Using Git to track the evolution of a codebase is incredibly important.
Git has proven to be one of the best friend of any coder.
It seems incredible to continue seeing Data Science projects without a Git repo: this tool not only allows collaborating and tracking the evolution of the code to revert in case of mistakes, it also gives a powerful mean for reproducibilty, an important matter for Data Scientits.
I think I could make an entire post about reproducibility in Data Science and another on Git, so I will not extend much.
But knowing how to use Git properly (not only "force push on master", but branches, merges, rebases, reverts,...) should be a basic skill.</p>
<p>In the same vein, GitHub's Pull Request system or GitLab's Merge Request system are a good tools in order to do <em>code review</em>.
Never have I seen a Data Scientist review the code of someone else.
Code reviews should be developed in the Data Science community, because it helps spot errors earlier and improves the communication in the team about the experiments done.
It also allows everybody in the team to understand the code and make it more reusable.</p>
<p>In Python, using virtual environments is also very important.
You can <a href="/articles/nix-love-and-hate">take a step further and use Nix</a> for completly reproducible environments but perfection comes at a cost.
A proper <code>requirements.txt</code> with every dependency should always be a must in order to onboard anybody on a project easily.</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list and I might update it as things come in my head.</p>
<h3>Good code please</h3>
<p>After the tools, it's the act of coding itself that can be improved in Data Science projects.
No need to say, most of the time the codebase in a Data Science project is a mess.
Not only directories and files are scattered in a random manner, but the code is not written in a consistent manner, it is not expressive, it is full of horrible variable names (like <code>x</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>something</code> or even better <code>h104b2_r</code>), a lot of code is copied and pasted (instead of a nice function)...
You can walk there and contemplate the deepest hills of hell of programming.</p>
<p>Code is often seen as a mean to run things on a computer.
While this has always been true, there is an underlying goal to coding.
It is not only the computer, but also <em>humans</em> that will read code.
If we only need machines to read code, we would have continued coding in binary, Assembly and such.
As it turns out, humans are not very good at grasping the higher meaning of a series of value assignement and gotos.
This is why we have developped much more abstract coding languages.</p>
<p>When people learn how to code, they start coding small projects on which they are working alone.
Even though it is not the most optimal, someone can keep track of the logics of a program in his head while coding, not needing things to be expressive and commented.
This becomes impossible for bigger projects and for collaborative projects.</p>
<p>When writing code, you should only think about two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>will it work</li>
<li>will my coworkers understand it</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering the first question is the most basic skill of a coder.
It's the second question that is more problematic and makes coding like a certain kind of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>For decades, Software Engineers have developped all kind of things in order to best fullfill this secondary quest of understandability.
Data Scientists should listen a thing or two about it, I'm sure it would help everybody.</p>
<p>In Python, PEP8 should be enforced in all projects.
Using strict formatters and linters like <code>black</code> and <code>flake8</code> is a great help.
Believe me, when you get used to that, it becomes really easy to read code quicker.</p>
<p>After the formatting, there are a number of coding rules that you should follow.
Usually they are more defined in terms of things to avoid than things to do.
You can learn about them by looking on the net and <a href="https://gist.github.com/sloria/7001839">falling on pages like this</a>, or you can read things such as <a href="https://www.investigatii.md/uploads/resurse/Clean_Code.pdf">this great book</a>.</p>
<p>There are also many good ideas from the world of functional programming such as pure functions, avoiding states, separating impurities as much as possible and so on.
Writing about it is also on my todo list !</p>
<h2>Towards "Full-stack Data Scientists" ?</h2>
<p>Data Scientists are not Software Engineers by default, because those two different jobs require two different skillsets, even though those skillsets share some common skills related to the fact that in both jobs code written, used and shared.
However, because they share those common skills, it is easier to start learning about one when you already know the other.
A Data Scientist can learn Software Engineering, a Software Engineer can learn Data Sciences.
To fuse both would give you an overpowered, super "Fullstack Data Scientist", the holy Grail seeked by so many companies, the super hero who can do anything, anytime, mastering the project technical parts from the very beginning to the very end (thus reducing costs and organizational issues).</p>
<p>I think we can hope to have more of these profils in the futur.
Not so many companies can continue doing researches on Data Sciences projects without following it with the development of applications.
On the other end, more and more applications want to integrate Data Science in their functions.</p>
<p>There is clearly a need for profiles who understand the stakes of both worlds, and have the technical skills to attend to issues that arise from the intersection of those worlds.</p>
<p>Will Data Scientists become just another kind of Software Developers ?
I don't think so, because the development of Data Science projects are more like R&#x26;D.
I insist: it is not the same job.</p>
<p>From there: do not expect Data Scientists to be able to build applications, but we should encourage the development of the culture of Software Engineering in order to improve Data Science projects.</p></div></div></div></main><footer style="text-align:center;padding:1em;color:#AAA">Guillaume Desforges © <!-- -->2020</footer></div></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/articles/are-data-scientists-devs";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"polyfill":["/polyfill-ca8adf9770cfeec4c092.js"],"app":["/app-ad67cb265854e65ca917.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-0db82d6eeee6490b835e.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-037087f6bdef211ec824.js"],"component---src-templates-article-template-js":["/component---src-templates-article-template-js-0ed56a67829c8ab1881c.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/polyfill-ca8adf9770cfeec4c092.js" nomodule=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-article-template-js-0ed56a67829c8ab1881c.js" async=""></script><script src="/commons-c8faa090aa439f9fb613.js" async=""></script><script src="/styles-e9d24b1846c7d6eb9685.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-ad67cb265854e65ca917.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-44697bb84c432a102996.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-4af22aa3d881e1b9345f.js" async=""></script></body></html>
