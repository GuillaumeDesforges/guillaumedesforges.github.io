Using this definition, and the proposition that Data Scientists are the people doing Data Science, we can infer a definition for Data Scientists, and this will be my own :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Data Scientists make analysis based on data using mathematics, computer sciences and additional knowledge on the business domain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, I have cheated and changed the last part, inspired by <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-three-cores-of-data-science-d58af0d7361e\">this famous chart</a>.\nData Scientists have a goal: do analysis using data.\nThis can be quite simple with only descriptive statistics, a few plots and some common sense.\nThis can be more complex using statistical methods and mathematical modeling to highlight mecanisms.\nThis can be the automation of decision-making processes (thus raising the term Artificial Intelligence) using inference algorithms and Machine Learning.\nThis can be so many different things I am not going to cover them all.</p>\n<p>In the end, in order to define what a Data Scientist is, what matters is</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the fact that they work on data,</li>\n<li>the skillset needed to be a Data Scientist : good fundamentals in mathematics, good skills in computer sciences and good understanding of the business.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is a nice definition that can be applied to many people who claim to be Data Scientists, but reality is not that simple.\nIn companies, it is not good enough to plot things, the send a Jupyter Notebook or a folder with Python scripts. <strong>In the real real life, people want applications</strong>.\nAnd that is the pain point.</p>\n<h2></h2>","frontmatter":{"date":"15-12-2019","path":"/articles/are-data-scientists-devs","title":"Are Data Scientists actually developpers ?","abstract":"A war rages in the open-space","tags":"data sciences, coding, software engineering"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://guillaumedesforges.github.io"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
