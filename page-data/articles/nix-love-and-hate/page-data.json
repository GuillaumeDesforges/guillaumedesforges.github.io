Once, he told me about his OS, which was something amazing and worked flawlessly. He told me the name: \"NixOS\". I quickly looked into it and for some time never really looked at it again.</p>\n<p>Somehow, my Manjaro dual boot had some issues and I had to wipe my laptop (like I always do when Linux f**ks my computers). As I was pulling my bootable USB key to install Manjaro again, I told myself: \"man, it's time to do it\", and I installed NixOS.</p>\n<p>When installing NixOS, you feel even more like a hacker than when installing Manjaro with Manjaro Architect. you have to do quite the same steps, but you do it on the command line. No fancy terminal GUI-like things to help you. It's just you, the command line and the NixOS manual.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"12-12-2019","path":"/articles/nix-love-and-hate","title":"Nix: a story of love and hate","abstract":"I love Nix but sometimes you can only hate it.","tags":"os, dev"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
