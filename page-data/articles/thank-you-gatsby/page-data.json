Basically I wanted to build a blog where I'd write articles as Markdown and that would render thoses pages. In the end, I always spent too much time on the design and not the functionality and dropped the project.</p>\n<p>Today, I don't know why really, I got motivated again, and I decided to use something I had heard of: GatsbyJs.</p>\n<p>It was so easy and quick to setup, and the documentation was really great in order to do exactly what I wanted. I barely had to think at all !</p>\n<p>It does what I want : I can make my own specific pages with HTML/React, and I can render my articles using a template made with React and writing the content in Markdown. Plus, the hot reloading is working and I think I got SSR (Server Side Rendering) for free !</p>\n<p>Here is the result. I wouldn't say that I'm proud of it since I did nearly nothing, but I am glad that finally things took a turn for the better and that such amazing framework like GatsbyJs were made.</p>\n<p>So I'll say it: thank you, people at GatsbyJs !</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"12-12-2019","path":"/articles/thank-you-gatsby","title":"Thank you Gatsby","abstract":"How I finally got a blog working in 5 minutes.","tags":"web, javascript, gatsby"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://guillaumedesforges.github.io"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
