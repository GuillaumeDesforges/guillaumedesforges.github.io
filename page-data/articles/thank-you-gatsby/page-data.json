Basically I wanted to build a blog where I'd write articles as Markdown and that would render thoses pages. In the end, I always spent too much time on the design and not the functionality and dropped the project.</p>\n<p>Today, I don't know why really, I got motivated again, and I decided to use something I had heard of: GatsbyJs.</p>\n<p>It was so easy and quick to setup, and the documentation was really great in order to do exactly what I wanted. I barely had to think at all !</p>\n<p>It does what I want : I can make my own specific pages with HTML/React, and I can render my articles using a template made with React and writing the content in Markdown. Plus, the hot reloading is working and I think I got SSR (Server Side Rendering) for free !</p>\n<p>Here is the result. I wouldn't say that I'm proud of it since I did nearly nothing, but I am glad that finally things took a turn for the better and that such amazing framework like GatsbyJs were made.</p>\n<p>So I'll say it: thank you, people at GatsbyJs !</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"date":"12-12-2019","path":"/articles/thank-you-gatsby","title":"Thank you Gatsby","abstract":"How I finally got a blog working in 5 minutes.","tags":"web, javascript, gatsby"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://guillaumedesforges.github.io"}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
